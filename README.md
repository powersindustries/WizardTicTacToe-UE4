# Wizard TicTacToe

## _Overview_

Wizard TicTacToe is the traditional TicTacToe game with a twist. Two Wizards battle each other by laying down one piece (`X` or `O`) at a time. When a wizard has three pieces in a row (by column, row, or diagonal), the wizard wins.

Once a game, each wizard is able to use their one spell slot to destroy any piece on the board. As collateral, either the column or row (chosen at random) around the piece will burn up in flames. Make sure your input is correct when casting spells. You dont want to mess up your incantation!
